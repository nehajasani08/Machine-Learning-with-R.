1. Using the dataset from http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/datasets/cuse.dat, consider  'wantsMore' as the output variable, Train the model using 70% of this dataset, Predict the test set using the trained model , Provide the confusion matrix and obtain the probability of correctness of predictions.  Write the functional form of your proposed classifier

2. Using Yahoo Finance API, select a specific stock market price,  apply
time series analysis (TSA), consider 'close price as your time series variable. Also,	Validate the assumptions using graphical visualization, fit the optimized model for 'close price' and provide the coefficient estimates for the fitted model. Find the estimated order for AR and MA. Forecast h=10 step ahead prediction of wage on the plot of the original time series.  '
